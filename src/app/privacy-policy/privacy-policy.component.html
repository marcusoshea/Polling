      <p>AE Polling ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how
        we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the AE Polling Mobile application ("App"). AE
        Polling is a tool for participating in polling for various Orders within the Kingdom of Æthelmearc, which you must already be a member of, in
        conjunction with the website <a href="https://polling.aethelmearc.org"
        target="_blank">https://polling.aethelmearc.org</a>.</p>
  
      <p>By using this App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  
      <h3>a. User-Provided Information</h3>
      <p>To use AE Polling, you are required to create an account either within the app or at <a
          href="https://polling.aethelmearc.org" target="_blank">polling.aethelmearc.org</a>. After your account has been approved,
        you may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select an Order to log into</li>
        <li>Participate in polls</li>
        <li>Store comments about candidates</li>
        <li>Update your name, email, and password</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is handled directly by the api-polling.aethelmearc.org website.</p>
  
      <h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>AE Polling does not collect or store personal information beyond the name and email address associated with
        your login credentials. All such data is managed by <a href="https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/"
        target="_blank">https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/</a>, which serves as the backend infrastructure for both the website and app.</p>
  
      <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>AE Polling does not independently collect, store, or process any personal or behavioral data, beyond temporary
        in-memory storage required to maintain your login session and name to attribute to your comments about candidates. 
        This includes temporary session state and authentication
        tokens that are not saved to persistent storage. The app functions solely as a client interface to the Æthelmearc Polling system.
        All user data is managed by <a href="https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/"
        target="_blank">https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/</a>.</p>
  
      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your data with third parties. Any data submitted through the app is
        transmitted directly to <a href="https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/"
        target="_blank">https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/</a> and is governed by the data management policies of that service.</p>
  
      <h2>4. Security</h2>
      <p>AE Polling follows standard Android security practices. All communication between the app and <a
          href="https://api-polling.aethelmearc.org/" target="_blank">api-polling.aethelmearc.org</a> is encrypted using secure
        protocols (HTTPS). The backend service is responsible for the encryption, protection, and storage of all user data
        submitted through both the app and website.</p>
